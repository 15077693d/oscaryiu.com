I have had my website since 2020.

At the time, I was working in the Manulife research team as a Python developer. Although my regular work was time and effort-consuming, I still studied and coded in Frontend development after work. Udmey, Codecademy, and Frontend mentor helped me a lot. I was passionate about frontend development to the point that I spent time doing regular weekly Frontend mentor exercises and 100 days of CSS challenges.

After a series of intensive practices, I built oscaryiu.com, my website with a blog and project summaries. It’s a gatsby’s static generation website with a Netlify CMS plugin. I am having so much fun building it. I knew what is CMS, and hosting worked after that.

Building oscaryiu.com boosts my confidence and frontend skillset so much.

After a year, I switch my career path from python development in the AI research team to frontend development
in the web3 industry. I appreciate the past year's practice to let me have such a good job opportunity.
In the new job, I mainly focus on wallet integration on a decentralized application, and smart contract
data fetching. Less time to deal with frontend styling and components implementation which makes me feel
a lack of confidence in frontend development.

Therefore I would like to build oscsryiu2.0. I want to boost my confidence and skill with the latest frontend tech just like in the past.

Apart from boosting confidence, the other reason is organizing my knowledge and some side project thoughts. I believe that sharing and teaching can make me learn fastly, sincerely, and deeply understand the concept. As a developer, I always face problems and search online. Once the problem is solved, I will leave the concept behind or forget the solution very quickly and search for the same question again and again. To break the death loop. I would like the consider this website as my knowledge base collection to share the concept and knowledge I got from my daily coding journey.

As a developer, I always think of some app and website ideas—for example, the football matching app or
a useful Figma plugin. My time management skill cannot chase the idea brain wave. After that, I have
no planning for the side project and leave the project behind. I would like to consider this website
as the progress logbook of the side projects also. To bring the idea to reality.

For Oscaryiu.com I have some features would like to do:

- [ ] Guestbook
- [ ] Multiple Languages Support
- [ ] Three.js elements
- [ ] Update projects
- [ ] Number of viewers in each post
- [ ] Giscus install
